# Agriculture Simulation Model with AnyLogic

## Overview
This project is a simulation-based model designed using **AnyLogic** to optimize the efficiency of agricultural utilities such as tractors, containers, and other resources, while ensuring crop growth remains unaffected and undamaged. The model integrates a machine learning (ML) algorithm to enhance decision-making, allowing for better resource allocation and operational planning.

## Features
- **Crop Simulation**: Models the growth cycle of crops with realistic environmental and operational parameters.
- **Utility Management**: Simulates the usage and movements of tractors, containers, and other equipment.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes an ML model to optimize resource efficiency and reduce operational costs without compromising crop health.
- **Damage Prevention**: Ensures that crop growth and quality remain intact during utility operations.

## Objectives
1. **Optimize Utility Usage**: Reduce fuel consumption, operational time, and wear-and-tear on equipment.
2. **Maintain Crop Health**: Ensure no damage is caused to crops during simulations of equipment operation.
3. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Employ machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis and operational optimization.
